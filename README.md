# Ecologi Public API Docs

This repo contains the docs for https://docs.ecologi.com/

These documents are deployed and displayed using [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)

## API Documents

Files in the [API](./API) folder automatically update the pages under https://docs.ecologi.com/docs/public-api-docs/ when pushed to master

## Landing Page

The "landing page", i.e. the content you see directly on https://docs.ecologi.com does not automatically update. We keep it up-to-date here in the file [`LandingPage.md`](./LandingPage.md), but when changed this must be manually copied into our [Stoplight account settings](https://docs.ecologi.com/admin/settings) under the heading "Landing Page".
