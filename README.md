# Welcome to your Ecologi workspace

Ecologi is a platform to reverse and halt climate change. We facilitate the funding of climate projects and tree planting projects around the world, allowing ordinary people to contribute to real climate action. Our mission is to remove 50% of global CO2 emissions by 2040 and to responsibly plant billions of trees every year. To find out more about Ecologi and our organisational mission, take a look at our [main site](https://ecologi.com/).

By bringing a community together to help restore our planet, we strive to create real positive change. We offer a range of product options, catering for individuals, families and businesses.

## Our Climate Action ‚úä

### üìâ Carbon reduction projects

You will fund the world's best climate crisis solutions. Our climate projects include renewable energy generation, rainforest protection, and community initiatives such as providing access to clean water.

Each and every tonne of carbon that we offset through these climate projects is certified by an industry-leading formal standard, such as Gold Standard or Verified Carbon Standard and we monitor our impact across all the projects we have funded.

[Find out more about our climate projects](https://ecologi.com/projects).

### üå± Tree-planting

Our main tree planting sites are in Madagascar, Mozambique and Nicaragua. We plant a native and biodiverse mix of tree species and our planting projects help to support local communities and reduce poverty by employing local workers.
We also offer local reforestation projects in the UK, Australia, and the US, where you can fund trees in your own country.

These baby trees grow to support communities and wildlife, improve soil and water quality, and boost the biodiversity of the local area.

With every account you will also get your very own impact profile. This allows you to track your climate action, grow your own virtual forest, and set yourself low-carbon lifestyle goals.

## Our core products

### üåç Personal & Family Subscriptions

Our subscription services allow you to become _Climate Positive_, meaning you fund climate solutions each month to offset the impact of your own carbon footprint, plus a bit extra. Alongside this you also plant trees and start growing your own forest. We offer plans which start at as little as ¬£1.25 a week and provide a simple way to supercharge your impact above just limiting your own damage.

_Note: Personal and family plans do not have access to the API services listed below. Please start a Climate Positive Workforce or sign up for an Impact Only account if you wish use our integrations._

### üå≥ Climate Positive Workforce

We offer businesses the opportunity to become a Climate Positive Workforce (CPW). All employees' carbon footprints are more than offset through this subscription. This includes emissions from both their professional and personal lives, including travel, holidays, food, hobbies and everything else! All CPW subscriptions include unlimited access to our API services listed below.

### üçÉ Impact only accounts

In an effort to make collective climate action accessible to all businesses, we offer what we call an "Impact Only" Ecologi account. Rather than a subscription you can add climate impact whenever suits you. You'll have full access to the API and integrations listed below if you wish to automate your climate impact, or you can buy it at any time from your Ecologi profile.
