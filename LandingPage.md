# Ecologi API

Ecologi is a climate action platform helping businesses take measurable, credible action for climate and nature.

Our APIs make it easy to embed climate action directly into your product or service—whether that's funding climate and nature projects automatically or reporting impact back to your users in real time.

Ecologi supports businesses across the net-zero journey with transparent, high-quality projects and clear, auditable reporting.

## Impact projects

With the Ecologi API, you can fund a variety of rigorously vetted climate and nature projects:

- **Tree planting** – restore degraded land with diverse, ecologically appropriate species
- **Carbon avoidance** – prevent emissions, e.g., rainforest protection, clean energy, or community initiatives
- **Carbon removals** – certified projects that permanently remove CO₂e from the atmosphere, such as biochar or enhanced rock weathering
- **Habitat restoration** – protect and regenerate ecosystems while supporting communities, e.g., wildflower or seagrass restoration

All projects meet stringent climate, nature, and social criteria. For each impact type, we assign a nominated project that you support via the API, and we periodically rotate these projects to ensure your funding continues to make the greatest impact. You can explore the full list on our [Impact Projects](https://ecologi.com/projects) page.
